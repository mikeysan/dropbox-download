# dropbox-download

With the assistance of ChatGPT, I wrote this script, because...who cares! I wanted to see if I could.

The script is a Python program that downloads files from Dropbox. It uses the Dropbox API to authenticate with Dropbox and list the files in a folder. It then downloads each file in the folder to a local directory.

The script is divided into two main parts:

- The first part authenticates with Dropbox and creates a database to track which files have already been downloaded.
- The second part traverses the folder structure and downloads each file to a local directory.

The script uses the following Python libraries:

- dropbox: This library provides access to the Dropbox API.
- sqlite3: This library provides access to SQLite databases.
- logging: This library provides logging functionality.
- concurrent.futures: This library provides support for concurrent execution of tasks.

The script is well-organized and easy to follow. The comments provide helpful explanations of the code. The logging statements provide useful information about the progress of the script.

Here are some suggestions for improving the script:

- The hardcoded path in the traverse_folder() function could be replaced with a run argument or user input.
- The script could be tested with different sets of files to ensure that it works correctly.
- The script could be optimized to improve performance.
